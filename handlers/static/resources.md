-   **Abba Moses Refusing to Judge His Brother**

    > A certain brother committed an offence in Scete, the camp of the
    > monks, and when a congregation was assembled ‎on this matter, they
    > sent after Abba Moses, but he refused to come; then they sent the
    > priest of the church to him, ‎saying, "Come, for all the people are
    > expecting you," and he rose up and came. He took a basket with a
    > hole in it ‎and filled it with sand, and carried it upon his
    > shoulders, and those who went out to meet him said unto him, "What
    > ‎does this mean, O father?" And he said to them, "The sands are my
    > sins which are running down behind me and I ‎cannot see them, and,
    > even, have come to this day to judge shortcomings which are not
    > mine." And when they heard ‎this they set free that brother and
    > said nothing further to him.‎

    > Do not be surprised that you fall every day; do not give up, but
    > stand your ground courageously. And assuredly the angel who guards
    > you will honour your patience. While a wound is still fresh and
    > warm it is easy to heal, but old, neglected and festering ones are
    > hard to cure, and require for their care much treatment, cutting,
    > plastering and cauterization. Many from long neglect become
    > incurable. But with God all things are possible \[Matthew 19:26\].

-   **Saying of Abba Mius**

    > A soldier asked Abba Mius if God accepted repentance. After the
    > old man had taught him many things he said, 'Tell me, my dear, if

    > it and use it again.' The old man said to him, 'If you are so
    > careful about your cloak, will not God be equally careful about
    > his creature?'
