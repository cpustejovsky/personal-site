This is the first blog post I've written that is on my website, not someone else's.

I wanted to get this built so I could maintain control of my content.

Thanks to Learn Go with Test's [chapter on templating]([https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/html-templates](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals/html-templates)) for providing a good foundation for this blog.
