# Declutter Your Internet

This is how the whole Internet is for me. I experience it without ads or annoyances. Whenever I see a part a website that clutters and distracts, I remove it with a couple of clicks.

I want to share how I do that.

All you have to do is switch to Firefox and install Ublock Origin.

## Firefox

Why do you need to switch to Firefox?

Chrome has made it impossible to install the Ublock Origin extension.

Is it any surprise? Google owns YouTube and makes most of its revenue off of ads. Of course they would find a comprehensive ad blocker to be against their "best practices".

The beauty of switching to Firefox is that you can install it on your phone. That means you can use extensions like Ublock Origin on your phone as well.

## Ublock Origin

After downloading and setting up Firefox, install [Ublock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).

It will block ads automatically.

If you want to block specific things like Google's AI overview, you can right click it and and select `Block Element`

Then you can pick and choose what part of the website you want removed! You don't need to know any custom CSS.

If that doesn't work, you can look up your problem and see if anyone has the CSS to block for a specific site. For example, to remove Google's AI Overview, I googled "Ublock Origin Google AI Overview".

For example, to remove Google's AI Overview:
1. Go to your uBlock Origin dashboard (click on the Gears when you pull up the extension in your browser).
2. Go to `My filters` and copy in `google.com##.hdzaWe`

To add a comment (text that the computer ignores), put an exclamation mark at the beginning.

So you can copy and paste something like
```
! Removing Google's AI Overview
google.com##.hdzaWe
```

It's as simple as that.

If you make a mistake when using the `Block Element` UI, the custom CSS will have dates so you can delete the lines under the date and time you made the mistake.

## Declutter Your Digital Life

I'm a software developer and spend most of my time in front of a screen so removing these distractions and clutter is essential for me.

But removing these distractions and clutter is useful for all of us.
